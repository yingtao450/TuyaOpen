===============================


.. figure:: ../images/TuyaOpen.png

TuyaOpen is an open source AI+IoT development framework that supports cross-chip platforms and operating systems. It is designed based on a universal southbound interface and supports communication protocols such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet. It provides core functionalities for AI+IoT development, including pairing, activation, control, and upgrading.
The sdk has robust security and compliance capabilities, including device authentication, data encryption, and communication encryption, meeting data compliance requirements in various countries and regions worldwide.

AI+IoT products developed using the TuyaOpen, if utilizing the functionality of the tuya_cloud_service component, can make use of the powerful ecosystem provided by the Tuya APP and cloud services, and achieve interoperability with Power By Tuya devices.

At the same time, the TuyaOpen will continuously expand, providing more cloud platform integration features, as well as voice, video, and facial recognition capabilities.
